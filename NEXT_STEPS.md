# 🚀 Next Steps - Enable Real-Time Updates

## What I Just Set Up:

✅ Created Google Apps Script code (see `SETUP_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT.md`)  
✅ Updated your roadmap HTML to support real-time data  
✅ Added fallback to CSV if Apps Script isn't configured yet  
✅ Pushed everything to GitHub

## What You Need to Do (5 minutes):

### 1️⃣ Open Your Google Sheet
Go to: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OksIlKgk7mgRNd6mdijk7Fzi8-4BMYzH/

### 2️⃣ Open Apps Script
- Click **Extensions** → **Apps Script**
- Delete any existing code
- Copy the script from `SETUP_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT.md`
- Paste it into the editor

### 3️⃣ Deploy as Web App
- Click **Deploy** → **New deployment**
- Click gear icon ⚙️ → Choose **Web app**
- Set:
  - **Execute as**: Me
  - **Who has access**: Anyone
- Click **Deploy** and **Authorize access**
- **COPY THE WEB APP URL** (looks like: `https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycby.../exec`)

### 4️⃣ Tell Me Your URL
- Come back here and paste the Web App URL
- I'll update your roadmap with it

## 🎯 After Setup:

### How It Will Work:
1. Your team edits the Google Sheet
2. Roadmap pulls data **directly from Google Sheets** in real-time
3. Refresh the page to see latest changes
4. No more CSV exports, no git commits needed!

### To Update Data:
- Just edit your Google Sheet
- Refresh the roadmap page
- That's it! ✨

## 📋 Files Created:

- `SETUP_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT.md` - Full setup instructions with script code
- `NEXT_STEPS.md` - This quick reference (you're reading it!)
- `BD5_to_BD1_Roadmap.html` - Updated to support Apps Script

---

## 🔧 Current Status:

⚠️ **Roadmap is currently using CSV** (until you provide Apps Script URL)

✅ Once you give me the Web App URL, I'll update it and your roadmap will be 100% real-time!
